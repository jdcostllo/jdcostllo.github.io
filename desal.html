                    I never could have predicted the magnitude of the challenges I would face on this trip nor could I predict how critically important this trip was to my career and my attitude toward engineering. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    In January 2018, on my second day of work as a technician in the MIT Global Engineering and Research (GEAR) Lab, I was on a flight to Israel with my new colleagues, preparing to finalize and commission a desalination system before its shipment into Gaza. The system arrived in shambles from our partner in India. After a month of tinkering, we barely faked a ribbon cutting ceremony in front of our sponsors at the United Nation (they were aware of the situation too). After the ribbons were cut and the banners were removed, my colleagues left, and I was left mostly alone, stuck in a shipping container in the desert of Israel. My task was to finalize and test the system before its shipment.

                    <p>
                        Success was my only option. For fear of being stuck any longer, I quickly learned a host of new skills to expedite the process and fix this broken, broken system. I spent hours in the stinking fumes of solder and PVC cement as I rewired the entire control cabinet and repaired the fault hydraulics. From this experience, I developed a newfound confidence designing relay logic, using a multimeter, soldering, assembling PVC hydraulics, and debugging electronics in the harshest conditions.

                    Work began quickly to develop the next generation GEAR Lab desalination pilot. It was born from the idea that electrodialysis desalination, an area of focus in the GEAR Lab, was uniquely well equipped for renewable power. This pilot would closely track the irradiance curve from a solar power system, operating slow in the morning and evening when the sun was low and operating fast when the sun was at its peak.    
                </p>
                <p>
                    Following my work in Israel, and with my newfound goal of bringing system design in house, I was set to design and construct the control system. In just a matter of months, I taught myself Python, built a user interface, and configured a programmable logic controller (PLC) to manage all of the sensors, VFDs, relays, and other important subsystems.

                    Work hadn't wrapped on the summer pilot system before the next pilot was already underway. This system would be a special showcase of our technology preempting a demonstration in India, where our industry sponsor was located.

                    For this project, I was assigned the role of hydraulics and power systems. Following the power requirements set by the student leading this research activity, I set about putting four large power supplies in a cabinet.

                        We still had unanswered questions about the final hydraulic configuration of this system, so meticulously modeled every hose, fittings, and tube in CAD to ensure every possible hydraulic connection was possible. A simple flip of a valve or two easily managed this flexibility.

                    After three and a half months in New Mexico, the team resolved to not send me to India for the next pilot. I was relieved, but that did not stop my commitment to the success of the next pilot: a commercial prototype in Medchal, India.

                    Every aspect of the Fall pilot was re-evaluated from pipe size to number of power supplies, to the placements of the pumps and filters. My hands-on experiences would help dictate every aspect of the new design. This first CAD screenshot was taken on December 7th at 2am, in preparation for a design review taking place remotely, in India.

                        By December 13th, I had completely re-engineered the design of this system three times, considering the feedback from the engineering team in India. This design met specific size constraints and considered the mobility of each welded steel structure. As always, every nut and bolt was modeled ensuring that even the smallest details were scrutinized.
