                <p>
                    In January 2018, on just my second day in the MIT Global Engineering and Research
                    (GEAR) Lab, I was on a flight to Israel. Just one day before, I had started a new role as a
                    <b>research specialist</b>. With my new colleagues, I'd be helping to prepare one of their
                    desalination pilot systems for commissioning before its shipment into Gaza. I never could have
                    predicted the magnitude of
                    the challenges I would face on this trip nor could I
                    predict how <b>critically important this trip was to my career and my attitude toward
                        engineering</b>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The system arrived in shambles from our partner
                    in India - they had dissassebmled it almost completely. After a month of nonstop tinkering, we
                    barely faked a ribbon cutting ceremony in front of our
                    sponsors at the United Nation. Fortunately, our sponsors were aware of the situation too and
                    prepared to help any way they could. After the ribbons were cut and
                    the banners were removed, my MIT colleagues left. I was left <b>mostly alone</b>, stuck in a
                    shipping
                    container in the desert of Israel. My task was to <b>finalize and test the system before its
                        shipment</b>.

                    For fear of being stuck any longer, I quickly <b>learned a host of new
                        skills</b> to expedite the process and fix this broken, broken system. <b>Success was my only
                        option</b>. I spent hours in the stinking
                    fumes of solder and PVC cement as I rewired the entire control cabinet and repaired the faulty
                    hydraulics. From this experience, I developed a newfound confidence designing <b>relay logic
                        circuits, using a
                        multimeter, soldering, assembling PVC hydraulics, and debugging electronics</b> in the harshest

                    Ultimately, the system was repaired, packed tight, and shipped just one month after the original
                    shipment date. I returned to Cambridge shaken, tired, and sore - but certainly not broken. <b>I had
                        a new goal: as long as I worked

                        systems would
                        be ours, from conception to commissioning.</b>

                    Work began quickly to develop the <b>next generation GEAR Lab desalination pilot</b>. It was born
                    from the
                    idea that electrodialysis desalination, an area of focus in the GEAR Lab, was uniquely well equipped
                    for <b>renewable power</b>. This pilot would closely track the irradiance curve from a solar power
                    system,
                    operating slow in the morning and evening when the sun was low and operating fast when the sun was

                    Following my work in Israel, and with my newfound goal of bringing system design in house, I was set

                        built a user interface, and configured a programmable logic controller (PLC) to manage all of

                    While this system was ultimately successful, I am the first to admit that I was in over my head. I
                    was never overwhelmed but realized that I was trying to learn too much at once. Consequently, the
                    quality of the system we deployed was not nearly as high as I had hoped. Still, as with all my
                    projects, I knew a clear path for applying these lessons to the next project. Fortunately, I

                    For this project, I was assigned the role of <b>hydraulics and power systems</b>. Following the

                    requirements set by the student leading this research activity, I set about putting four large power
                    supplies in a cabinet along with some smaller supplies and a collection of relays and contactors.

                    By December 13th, I had completely re-engineered the design of this system three times, considering
                    the feedback from the engineering team in India. This design met specific size constraints and
                    considered the mobility of each welded steel structure. As always, every nut and bolt was modeled
                    ensuring that even the smallest details were scrutinized.

                    Just a few late nights later, the system was built in its entirety. Our <b>sponsor was thoroughly
                        impressed</b>. After a year of exhausting work that began in the desert of Israel, I felt that
                    this
                    final system was a perfect showcase of everything the rest of the team and I had learned. I couldn't
                    be more proud of this showcase.

                    Somehow, in this short year, I had traveled over 50% of the time. I started as a naive, young
                    engineer fumbling a multimeter in a shipping container in Israel and ended up hardened by the
                    experience building substantial systems and subsystems in multiple desalination pilots.

                    In 2019, I left MIT, and started a new role as a technical instructor at Boston University. You can
                    see some of my work at BU here, in another Portfolio entry: <a href="automation.html">Teaching
                        Principles of Automated Manufacturing</a>.

                <p>
                    When returned to MIT in 2021, I knew I'd be continuing my work on the desalination team. This time,
                    I'd have a more initimate role with the scientific modeling and system design. My transition from a
                    staff member to a student was in September 2022. <b>As a student, I've had the perfect opportunity to
                    lean into my years of hands-on experience while improving my scientific skillset</b>. Presently, I'm
                    working on design of large, municipal-scale desalination systems. Upon completetion of that work,
                    which <b>wraps in August 2024</b>, I'll be eager to share it here.
