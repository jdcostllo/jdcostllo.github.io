                    My return to Boston University was interesting. I wasn’t sure exactly how I’d feel as a staff member compared to when I was a student. I’d be a technical instructor, especially for the course ME345 Automation and Manufacturing Methods. I was shocked to find how little had changed since I took the course as an undergraduate student in 2016.

                    The system consisted of Teledyne-Dalsa vision systems, Haas CNC machines, an old Rockwell PLC, and three middle-aged Universal Robots UR5s. I was expected to know each of these systems intimately and debug them constantly for the 28 students who entered this space each semester.

                <p>
                    I never expected that I would completely reimagine the automation software. Originally it was a crummy attempt by an external contractor built in LabView.  Then, when COVID unexpectedly swept the world, I took it upon myself to stay active.

                    I began with Python, trying to understand all of the API calls for the different machines in the lab. I would go into the lab and test individual scripts and machine behaviors. I quickly got familiar with web sockets, SSH, file servers, CAN, RS485, and dozens of other interfaces I needed to test, debug, and control the system.

                <p>
                    Simultaneously, I was conceptualizing a control scheme where multiple “processes” could simultaneously share the limited resources in the lab, seizing and releasing each resource to slowly inch through its unique manufacturing process. Later, I realized that I had unintentionally stumbled onto queue theory.

                    Within a semester, this project exploded from a single Python script into a full-blown web application with multiple user interfaces, each showcasing a different aspect of automation. The software collected execution times and other data for students to process. Eventually, I even hired and managed two brilliant computer engineering students to further improve the software and give it a polish.

                    It is challenging to express the number of lessons learned as part of this work. I have a newfound appreciation for the challenges of attaining reliable automation, both in hardware and software. I am relieved to hear the software is still running today, with the occasional bug fix.
