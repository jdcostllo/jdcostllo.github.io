            <h1>Teaching Principles of Automated Manufacturing</h1>
            <h3>Developing custom industrial automation software to teach university students.</h3>

            <p>This work was completed during my employement at Boston University as a <b>Laboratroy Supervisor</b> at
                the <a href="https://www.bu.edu/epic/">Engineering Product Innovation Center (EPIC)</a>, located at 750

                <p>In 2019, I returned to my alma mater, Boston University, as a staff member. I felt a bit odd at first
                    - I wasn't sure exactly how
                    I'd feel as a staff member compared to when I was a student. Now, I'd be a <b>technical
                        instructor</b>,
                    especially for the course ME345 Automation and Manufacturing Methods.</p>
                <p>As I stepped into the Automated Design and Manufacturing Laboratory (ADML), I was shocked to find how
                    little
                    had changed since I took the
                    course myself back in 2016.</p>


            </div>

    <div class="container" style="padding-top: 25px; padding-bottom: 25px;">

            <div class="col portfolio-text" style="min-width: 400px;">
                <p>I was expected to know each of these systems intimately and
                    debug them constantly for the <b>28 students</b> who entered this space <b>each semester</b>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The system consisted of...
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Three Teledyne-Dalsa vision systems
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Two Haas CNC machines
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A 1994 Rockwell PLC controlling a conveyor
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Three middle-aged Universal Robots UR5s
                    </li>
                </ul>
                This mess of mismatched systems was controlled by custom automation software prepared in Labview from an
                external contractor - same as it was in 2016. The code was riddled with bugs and never worked. I felt my
                three-year-old frustation I felt as a student reignite as I stepped into my new instructor role.</p>

                <p>
                    Still, I never expected that <b>I would completely reimagine the automation software</b>. But when
                    COVID unexpectedly swept the
                    world, I found myself in an awkward position asking, "My job is almost entirely hands-on, in-person.
                    How can I stay active?."

                    I began working at home, hours on end, with Python, trying to understand all of the API calls for
                    the different machines in the
                    lab. I would go into the lab and test individual scripts and machine behaviors. I quickly got
                    familiar with <b>web sockets, SSH, file servers, CAN, RS485</b>, and dozens of other interfaces I
                    needed to
                    test, debug, and control the system.

                    As I was writing small API and test scripts and rewriting all of the laboratroy exercises, I was
                    still conceptualizing a control scheme where multiple <b>“processes” could
                        simultaneously share the limited resources</b> in the lab, seizing and releasing each resource
                    to slowly
                    inch through its unique manufacturing process. Later, I realized that I had unintentionally stumbled
                    onto <b>queue theory</b>.

                    Within a semester, this project exploded from a single Python script into a full-blown <b>web
                        application</b>. It was dubbed "BUMES," the <b>Boston University Manufacturing Execution
                        Software</b>. There were multiple user interfaces, each showcasing a different aspect of
                    automation, showcasing each of the laboratroy exercises. The
                    software collected execution times and other data for students to process. Eventually, I even
                    <b>hired
                        and managed</b> two brilliant computer engineering students to further improve the software and
                    give it
                    a polish.

                    It is incredibly challenging to express the number of lessons learned as part of this work. There
                    were weeklong trials learning everything from how to write <b>loops in G-Code to debugging CAN
                        networks
                        to writing ASCII text commands</b> for the oldest PLC I've ever used. I have a newfound
                    appreciation for the challenges of attaining reliable automation, both in hardware and software.
                </p>

                <p>As is inevtiable when embarking on these journeys, there is much that I would go back and redo.
                    However, as of writing, I am pleased to hear <b>the software is still used today to teach
                        students</b>. See more of my sidequests in the ADML on my <a href="other.html">Noteworthy
