            <h1>Automated, Effective Fish Feeding</h1>
            <h3>Developing and prototyping a manifold selector valve for automated waterborne fish feeding.</h3>
            <p>This work was completed as part of course requirements for <b>MIT Course <a href="https://meche.mit.edu/featured-classes/global-engineering">2.76: Global Engineering</a></b>.
                Professor
                Amos Winter is the instructor. My teammates were Conor Briggi, Anna Duncan, Penelope Herrero-Marques,
                and Francisco Sepulveda. This work was in collaboration with our <b>industry partner, <a

                    2.76: Global Engineering is a course which seeks to enable students with the tools and techniques
                    required to design products with <b>global impact</b>. There is special emphasis on stakeholder
                    dyanmics, multi-market opportunities, humanitarian impact, culture considerations, and engineering
                    science.
                </p>

                <p>To ensure the relevance of our technology, our team was paired with <a
                        href="https://www.innovasea.com">Innovasea Systems Inc.</b></a> who would carefully guide our
                    engineering efforts throughout the semester.</p>

                    Each member of the team had different roles throughout the semester. One of my earlier roles was
                    <b>market identification</b>, where I discovered the growing need for sustainable aquaculture.
                </p>
                <p>After many calls with by Innovasea, we were reassured that <b>automation</b>, specifically in their
                    waterborne fish feeding system was a logical path toward sustainable market growth. Moreover, this
                    was a particular <b>area of interest for Innovasea</b>, who was seeking a means to quickly and
                    reliably
                    disperse waterborne fish food to multiple cages in an aquaulture installation.

                    I was inspired by a YouTube video from <a
                        href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu_1S77XkiM&t=786s">Stuff Made Here</a> to use principles
                    of <b>mechanical multiplexing</b> in the final design for this "manifold selector valve." After
                    considerable, productive debate amongst members of the team, this was selected as the final design
                    concept.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I reassured the team that I'd be able to build both a <b>PLC control</b> cabinet and use <b>low
                        cost</b> actuator,
                    namely a wiper motor, to accomplish the most critical tasks set by our <b>functional
                        requirements</b>. Fortunately, we worked well together and each took on a substaintial portion
                    of the design, fabrication, and testing.

                    After a few quick sketches, my teammate Penelope and I were on the same page about the unit
                    <b>testing</b> we'd need to do to verify the <b>electromechanical subsystems</b> in the final
                    prototype. Most important was the function of the wiper motor along with a multi-turn potentiometer
                    we used as an encoder.

                    The wiper motor operated as predicted by the <b>engineering math</b> I has used to originally select
                    this motor. With its four-time safety factor, it easily overcame the 16 Nm of torque required to
                    open and
                    close the large, 3 inch diameter, off-the-shelf ball valves we were using in the final design. While
                    I fabricated and tested the wiper actuator, the rest of the team was managing the fabrication of the
                    frame and valve assembly.

                    I had closely worked with my teammate Penelope throughout the semester, leveraging my background as
                    a <b>technical instructor</b> to give her the tools and background knowledge necessary to conduct
                    simple tests on the PLC. Still, my background in <b>industial automation</b> became quite important
                    toward the end of the project, as I finalized the control cabinet and wired each of the sensors.
                    toward the end of the project. The PLC control and code was relatively simple, comprised of only...
