                <h1>About Me</h1>

                <p>
                    I was born and raised in a suburb of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. In the fall of 2013, I began my
                    undergraduate education at Boston University. Since 2013, I've called Boston and its suburbs home.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Not long after graduating, I found myself fortunate to secure a role as a technician with a
                    mechanical engineering research group at MIT, the <a href="https://www.gear.mit.edu/">Global
                        Engineering and Research (GEAR) Lab</a>. I
                    spent years surrounded by brilliant researchers, engineers, and scientists helping them advance
                    their research and design field pilots. Like those brilliant researchers, I was deeply motivated by
                    the opportunity to work on projects which sought to bring tangible, beneficial, global change to
                    irrigation, desalination, prosthetics, and more.
                </p>

                <p>
                    While I was working as a technician, never once did I consider that I'd become a student again, let
                    alone at MIT.
                    Unexpectedly, and as of writing this, here I am now, approaching the completion of my master's of
                    science in mechanical engineering at MIT in the GEAR Lab (now the GEAR Center). I couldn't be more
                    fortunate or more grateful for this
                    magical
                    opportunity.</p>
                <p>As I approach the next step in my career, I hope to continue paying forward my great
                    fortune. <b>I hope to continue working on world-changing technologies
                        that break barriers, upset
                        existing markets, and enable more people with the tools and technologies that will not only
                        positively impact their careers but positively impact their lives as well.</b>
                </p>
