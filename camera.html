                <p>Power Electronics Laboratory was, beyond a shadow of doubt, the <b>most rewarding</b> and <b>most
                        challenging</b> course I have ever taken. Now, more than ever, I feel like I have some grasp of
                    this
                    fascinating and rewarding field of engineering.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I've always wanted to be better at <b>applied electronics</b>. I've leveraged my fascination in
                    electronics as part of my work
                    designing and constructing PLC-based controllers and data acquisition systems in the GEAR
                    Lab. Still, I yearned for a more foundational understanding of circuit design including the
                    <b>selection of integrated
                        circuits, power system design, and troubleshooting strategies</b>. Power Electronics Laboratory
                    satisfied this curiousity and much, more more.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The semester began with simple <b>linear and switching power regulators</b>, introducing the very
                    basics of circuit design. My first circuits were tangled messes of wires and components. I very
                    quickly learned to clean my mess and work with short, tight wires. Neat circuits were
                    easier to troubleshoot and were less susceptible to interference.

                    It wasn't long before we were introduced to "<b>Totems</b>," which is a configuration of MOSFETs and
                    MOSFET
                    drivers that allow a low power circuit to control higher power devices. These yellow-ish boards were
                    designed in 2004 but were still an integral part of the course in 2023. Nearly every project after
                    this point would require us to use a Totem board, stretching our understanding of how this
                    relatively simple circuit could be used in real devices.

                <p>
                    To drive the Totem, we built a number of <b>delay circuits</b> that could "make" and "break" the
                    electrical
                    connections between the high power and ground connections in the Totem. In this way, we could
                    control the high power device at our output without frying the Totem itself. Eventually, I got
                    pretty quick at the <b>governing mathematics</b> behind this simple circuit. I was pretty fast to
                    build
                    them too - and my wiring was slowly starting to look better.

                    We built a number of cool circuits over the course of the semester including a class-D audio
                    amplifier, a fluorescent lamp ballast, a motor controller, and a switched capacitor power supply.
                    With every exercise, I felt new confidence. I was grasping the <b>circuit math and design</b>. I
                    meticulously made <b>schematics</b> to follow. I was learning the tricks to use an
                    <b>oscilloscope</b> effectively.

                    The course culminated in a final project. Originally I wanted to build a sinker electrical discharge
                    machine (EDM) power supply but that idea was (understandably) deemed unsafe ðŸ˜…. Instead, I decided
                    to
                    design a
                    prototype of a "battery" powered, "remote controlled," linear camera slide. I combined a few
                    concepts...
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Switched Capacitor Power Supply
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Boost Converter
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        2 H-Bridges to Drive a Stepper Motor
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Programmable System on a Chip (PSoC)
                    </li>
                </ul>
                I rationalized that this "camera slide" would be battery powered and allow a photographer or
                videographer to capture shots in the field. The PSoC handle the timing for the H-Bridges. The PSoC also
                managed the boost converter, allowing the user to shut down the high power system and control the
                output voltage. This extra control allowed the user to conserve the theoretical "battery." The switched
                capacitor power supply sipped power,
                keeping the PSoC awake when the high power circuitry was powered down.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I kept the mechanical design simple. Nonetheless, I still wanted to put my personality into the
                    design, with a bit of extra care taken to make it aesthetically pleasing and easy to use.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The camera slide worked. Although there were bugs and much I would like to improve, I still felt a
                    massive sense of accomplishment after this challenging, sleepless
                    semester. I could not be prouder of my accomplishments in this course. I don't expect that power
                    electronics circuit design will foundational in my career - there are better circuit designers out
                    there - but <b>courses like Power Electronics have always proven invaluable in my ability to
                        communicate between engineering disciplines</b> in order to solve problems and bridge gaps
                    between subsystems.
